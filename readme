- run from terminal: ./setup.sh
- edit header of auto_setup_yolo.sh (addresses of darknet root, images and annotations)
- run in terminal: ./auto_setup_yolo.sh

- set gpu=1 in makefile
- make
- when using (e.g. to train or test), switch to sudo user

## Docker

Use this docker command for training

```bash
docker run -it -v /home/sohaib/Documents/kodifly/3d_forest/:/forest_3d_app --gpus=all -p 8888:8888 daisukekobayashi/darknet:darknet_yolo_v4_pre-gpu bash
```
